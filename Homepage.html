            Hello world, my name is Pavel and I am a cS50 student. In this page I would like to share essays which I have written.

            The essays, you will see, are from many subjects. Click above to choose the language of my texts (it's not the translation).

            First, you might wanna know something about me. I come from Czech Republic and I attend a gymnazium in Prague. My favourite subjcets apart from CS50 are Maths and Physics. I especially enjoy competitions in these subjects because seemingly, I adore problem solving! Outside the school, I do a lot of things. I love sports cars, my favourite manufacturer is without any doubt Koenigsegg. However, I like the design of other cars as well - McLaren, Lamborghini and Opel are purty cool. As well, I love music. My favourite genre is electric music. Martin Garrix and Marshmello are just simply my taste. However, there is one more thing I like pretty much. I like the Boston Bruins because the're the best xd. If you're from Montreal, I will understand you quiting this page and I'm sorry for that XD. What is the most in my life, my family. I love them because they support me and give me all their love. And I love them too, they are super duper. Spending time with them is the most entertaining activity I will ever imagine.
