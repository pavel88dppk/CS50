        <h2>“THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AFFECTED CHINA SOCIALLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER EVENT BETWEEN THE YEARS 1949-63.”</h2>
        <h2>To what extent do you agree with this statement?</h2>
        <p> Many events were leaving giant scars on the Chinese community between the years 1949 and 1963. However, the social consequences of the Great Leap Forward are often regarded to be the most devastating. In this essay, I would like to describe the social effects of other significant events and say why the Great Leap Forward had the most profound impact on Chinese society.
        </p>
        <p> One of the most serious problems had arrived in the time of early reforms in the People’s Republic of China because people were forced to accuse each other, consequently, humiliating the whole landlord class. The landlords were classified as one of the greatest enemies of the regime. The ruling party, CCP, therefore began the Land Reform. Its purpose was to reorganize and redistribute land owned by the landlords. In 1950, when the reform took place, millions of landlords were killed. The reforms were followed by “Speak Bitterness” meetings. The goal was to encourage masses to fight and accuse the class enemies, the landlords. Not every time were the fates of the landlords accompanied by their death. In some regions the accused victims were deprived of their land; nonetheless, allowed to rest in the area they lived. The main social effect of the early reforms was that for the first time since the People’s Republic of China was declared, the inhabitants of China were forced to massively fight against some group classified as a common enemy to the regime. The significance of this is that the population became divided. The event called Thought Reform contributed to the division as well.  Each member of the communist party acknowledged any doubts about the party. They said what bad they had done as well as they exposed the incorrect behaviour of anyone they knew. The poor classes were those days supported by the state whereas the rich classes became the enemies; thus, the second major effect of the early reforms was that the landlord class became extinct. This is significant because about 300 million peasants thenceforth owned a total of 47 million hectares of land. However, as the peasants weren’t prepared for accepting such a large area, they were lacking equipment and some “staff” which they would use for ploughing and harvesting. There was certainly no turning back because the landlord class was forever gone and their holding was already redistributed.
        </p>
        <p> A massive crackdown against all people criticising the communist regime was the result of the Hundred Flowers Campaign. Mao Zedong initially let the community criticise him and the party via Democracy walls on which the citizens had the opportunity to write their complaints. However, at one moment Mao decided to completely change what he previously stated and instead of hearing out the critics, he started punishing everyone who said a word against the communists. Since then, all the people who did so were imprisoned or in some cases even killed. The reverse of his policy is known as the Anti-rightist campaign and was targeted predominantly on the intellectuals. It is a well-known fact that the intelligentsia usually stands out by speaking against the regime as well as they value the freedom of speech more than other people. There are two versions of why Mao at first let the people publicly criticise him. Either it was that he wanted to find his enemies and subsequently get rid of them or he naturally wanted to know the opinions of his subjects. However, the effect was still the same, from that moment it became apparent that none person could say a word against the regime, otherwise, he would be punished. The result of the Anti-rightist campaign was that four million people were killed. Besides, the Chinese intelligentsia was decimated. The reason why this is important is that the community was suppressed and de facto deprived of a common right called freedom of speech.
        </p>
        <p> The Great Leap Forward was the event which brought up probably the most serious social consequences such as creating rivalry within the peasants and other inhabitants. The thought that China could continue with the success in the First Five-Year Plan was tremendous. However; hoping that subjects would multiply the effectiveness of their work only because of the motivation was fatuous. The regime was stating absurd goals. For example, they wanted to overcome Great Britain in steel production. Such targets mostly ended unsuccessfully. Considering steel production, about twice a large amounts were produced; however, this steel lacked quality; therefore, could be classified as useless. In completing different goals set by the party, Chinese population became unfriendly. People accused each other of doing something unproperly only to earn extra points in front of the communist party. As well the community was encouraged to compete. For example, the habitants of China were assigned to kill the sparrows which damaged the yield of agriculture. People immediately began to challenge who would kill the most sparrows. This feature came up to be contra-productive because generally, the sparrows take control of killing all pests and insects; hence, the vermin overpopulated. As a result, the yields were harmed even more. Considering the life in cities, the townspeople were facing serious problems as well. Because of the small yields in the rural parts of China, they lacked food. However, the situation wasn’t as bad because the peasants had to sell their crops for the price stated by the government. These were mostly sold into cities, assuring that the citizens wouldn’t die of hunger. Generally, the Great Leap Forward was a huge catastrophe because the assigned goals weren’t analysed by experts. Bad management had a great effect on China in terms of social life. The fact that the challenges set by Mao weren’t well thought out lead to the Great Famine. Over 50 million people died of hunger and millions committed suicide. In order not to die of famine people often ate other people or at least hid their food resources in front of the Communist Party members because they would have to sell them for the people in cities. This is important because the party started investigating every village which reported that there was no food left. The Chinese had to lie to live and that is inadmissible.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, it is important to say that all three events formed the archetype of Chinese society. As a result of the events mentioned, people often fought and accused each other only because they wanted to look well in front of the party. The heads of the state role in a cruel manner, making it impossible to criticize the regime. Anyone doing so would be punished. However, the most significant event was the Great Leap Forward as it not only encouraged people to compete with each other but as well forced the peasants to lie in order to survive. The Great Leap Forward created such fearsome conditions that the people in some cases ate each other; therefore, clearly, I agree with the statement on the top.

        <h2>How far had discrimination, experienced by black Americans in 1945, been removed by 1968?</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Situation after World War II. was confusing. Blacks didn’t have equal rights to the whites at all. Furthermore, they were forced to live their life in places secluded from the white’s community. They were prepared to fight for their rights and for desegregation. There were many movements whose impact was to fight off segregation. Many people speculate that the overall impact was predominantly a de jure impact, but is it true? Weren’t there at least decent de facto changes? As far as I’m concerned, the movements did mostly affect the de jure change, nonetheless there were many significant steps in the de facto change as well.</p>
        <h3>Voting</h3>
        <p>To summarise my views on the matter, the situation de jure changed considerably between years 1945 and 1968, though the de facto situation wasn’t different to such an extent. In year 1945 the blacks were able to vote thanks to the 15th amendment (1870) which said that the US citizens had the right to vote. However, being registered to vote wasn’t technically feasible at all. There were two ways to become a registered voter – you had to pay some money and write a test to show your literacy skills or you had to have grandparents who had already been registered to voting. In year 1964, things were about to change. Activists from civil rights groups SNCC, CORE and NAACP tried to increase the rate of black voters in the campaign called Mississippi Freedom Summer. This campaign didn’t rise the de facto voting rate much, however it was medialized, so the US citizens noticed that something isn’t all right. In this campaign a new political party was created, it associated people in Mississippi who were against segregation. The significance of this campaign was, that the president Johnson didn’t support the black rights to such an extent because he was afraid to lose other voters. Year 1965 brought some significant changes. Selma campaign was as well a part of the Civil Rights Movement. This was a campaign, with the purpose to raise de facto the number of black voters, organized by activists from SNCC and SCLC. This campaign attracted many people, its climax was a fifty-mile march from Selma to Montgomery. 25 000 people participated, this showed that the people do care about these matters. Same as the Mississippi Freedom Summer, it highlighted the topic to the rest of the world. The big de jure and de facto change came on 6th August 1965, when president Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, suspending the literacy tests (one of the requirements to become a valid voter), therefore, adding 250 thousand black voters in the south. Regarding this topic in terms of de facto change, four states in the south had less than 50% black citizens with the right to vote. The blacks sometimes didn’t vote because they were afraid to be lynched by the whites. The discrimination in voting wasn’t removed much, however, great conditions for future were set. The biggest raise of black voters came up with the year 1965 when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I am entirely convinced that the de jure change between years 1945 and 1968 was really significant thanks to the supreme court cases, nevertheless it didn’t make such an important de facto metamorphose. In year 1945 the schools were segregated. Blacks attended schools intended only for blacks. These schools had a lack of furniture, text books etc. The complete de jure change came up in year 1954 with the case Brown v. Board. A young Afro-American girl wanted to attend a school for whites due to her house being way too far from the closest black school. The “white school” refused to let her study there. This case was taken to the supreme court which then prohibited segregation in education. Although since 1954 de jure segregation is banned, the de facto change didn’t appear much. In year 1957 desegregation was supressed in The Little Rock Campaign. Nine black students were put into a local school for whites. After the National Guard is called, the school closes and the case is taken to the supreme court. They say that it is illegal to prevent desegregation. In year 1962 a similar case appears which enlarges the de facto change. James Meredith attempted to become the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi. With the help of troops, he managed to get to school which he finally graduated. This showed that it is possible to graduate a school for whites even though you’re of a different race than expected. In my opinion, if there were more cases like this, entangling two races together would become common. The discrimination wasn’t removed at all, however, I stand by my opinion that de facto changes will set down by time going by. The most striking change was made in the middle 50s.</p>
        <h3>Segregation</h3>
        <p>Concerning segregation in de jure, the advance since year 1945 was big as well as the progress in de facto. The situation in year 1945 looked really pessimistically. Many public places were secluded. The blacks couldn’t visit libraries, restaurants or had to travel in secluded parts of public transport, they attended schools only for blacks and lived in the least fancy places and houses. Talking about the de jure changes, in year 1947 “To Secure These Rights” was released by the US government. It proposed to end all discrimination and segregation based on race, colour, or national origin in the organization and activities of all branches of the Armed Services. This was further developed. In year 1956 there were the Montgomery bus boycotts. A woman called Rosa Parks sat on a place designated for white people. She refused to give up her seat when a white person appeared. The blacks stopped using public buses as a form of protest. It was clearly visible how powerful blacks were. Once this case was taken to the Supreme Court, it outlawed segregation of buses. Four years later new civil rights groups were formed in the Greensboro sit-ins event. A black student refused to leave his seat in a restaurant until he was served. Many people joined the following days, therefore evoking skirmishes. These skirmishes became brutal and bloody. After the number of people protesting reached seven thousand it resulted in desegregation of public places. Very important factor playing role in de jure changes were The Freedom Rides. A group of activists set on an interstate bus. On their way they were slaughtered by racists. Martin Luther King was involved and supported the Freedom riders, therefore, forcing president Kennedy to enforce the interstate bus segregation. In year 1964 the Civil Rights Act was signed by president Johnson outlawing racial segregation in schools, employment, and public accommodations. There were de facto changes in these campaigns as well, the whites were haughty so the de jure changes were turning to de facto only by time. They had a subtle but distinct effect on how black people regarded their place in the society. Bringing back the original question, the discrimination wasn’t removed entirely, nevertheless a significant change was recorded thanks to the Civil Rights Movement. That’s when the biggest de facto improvement was recorded.</p>
        <h3>Economy</h3>
        <p>To the best of my knowledge, the de jure improvement of the black’s economy was really big, however I suppose that a 100% equality wasn’t reached. The de facto improvement is large as well especially in terms of employment. In year 1945 the average salary of a black man was about a third of the salary of a white man. Blacks were much more likely to live in poverty with bad accommodation. In year 1960, 25 out of 31 states with the highest proportion of Afro-Americans came up with the Fair Employment Practice. These were laws which prohibited discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex and national origin. In year 1963, there was the Equal Pay Act which was fighting for equal salaries for men and women. The de facto effect of the Fair Employment Practice was, that the black’s unemployment rate was only 7% and in 1968 their average income per capita was 61% of the average income of a white. That is not really much, however it could have been even worse. The 1968 Fair Housing Act de jure prohibited discrimination in 80% of America’s employment. However, de facto nothing changed because the fine, when there was racial discrimination, was worth only one thousand dollars so people didn’t care. As far as I’m concerned, the biggest change happened between years 1960 and 1968. The significance of this to the topic question is that the discrimination was almost removed in the employment and income, however, there was not equality in housing at all.</p>
        <h3>Remaining problems</h3>
        <p>My view on this issue is that although the de jure and de facto remaining problems weren’t solved, trying to solve them was highly beneficial in other sections. The goals of Black Power Movement were to encourage the economic development, self-esteem and to improve the conditions in the northern ghettos. The Black Power Movement gave the rise of Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam which both protrude by their extremist opinions. The Black Panther Party was a radical political organization fighting for black rights since 1966. They mainly focused on self-defence, economic improvements and on improving conditions in northern ghettos. They looked up to Malcom X and propagated the ideas to stand up to racist authorities. To defend the blacks, they organized their own militia who protected the black neighbourhood. The Nation of Islam is an extremist movement as well fighting for black rights.  Their aim was to raise self-confidence, pride and stability of the black community especially in ghettos. They wanted to live separate from the whites by creating a new all-black state. For a while their member was Malcom X who had radical opinions and gave the rise of Black Power. His opinions were different from the points of view of Martin Luther King and he didn’t approve of the Civil Rights Movement. Thanks to the radicalism of the Black Power Movement, the ideas of Martin Luther King became de facto more acceptable. The remaining problems were being solved around the year 1968.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I think it’s reasonable to say that in every section except of the remaining problems the de jure changes were dominating. This was because people cannot get used to something immediately, you ought to give them some time to habituate. Despite the time, de facto changes were big as well, although the racial equality wasn’t reached. Based on my thoughts, I believe that the discrimination was removed predominantly de jure, nonetheless de facto changes were significantly big to take note about.</p>
